# PHP_University_Grading_System
A simple PHP project that works as a University Grading System with lots of features.

You can see Screenshots of the project in "Screenshots of Project" folder.

At first you have to Create the Database in Mysql with database script file with .sql extension that is located in "Database Files" folder.and then you should change "db.php" file so that the Database Server and Database username and password match your own Database Server and Credential.
there are two database files and you should use only one of them.there's a Database export from Wamp and there's another Database export from "Direct Admin" panel.the export from wamp does not include any pre-entered data and samples.but the "Direct Admin" export includes pre-entered data and samples and i recommend to use this one if it's compatible with your Mysql version.

Admin password for the Project in the Wamp database export is '1' and admin password for 'Direct Admin' db export is 'admin1395'.Admin passwords are stored with MD5 hash in Database.

I have also included a folder named "Excel Samples" that you can use them as samples to be used in Professors Panel.you can upload the grades in excel files so that every Professor uploads the grade of his/her students as an excel file.you can see the format of excel files in the "Excel samples" folder.there are also other excel files so that you can see the errors of upload section. if there is an error like "max file size exceeds" or "a student's grade is not entered in excel file" and etc... it handles the error and gives the user the proper message.

i have also included a file named "PHP Grading Project.rar" that all the files that are uploaded here are included in this file.so feel free if you need to download it.
