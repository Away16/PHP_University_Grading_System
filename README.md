# PHP_University_Grading_System
A simple PHP project that works as a University Grading System with lots of features.

You can see Screenshots of the project in "Screenshots of Project" folder.

At first you have to Create the Database in Mysql with database script file with .sql extension that is located in "Database Files" folder.and then you should change "db.php" file so that the Database Server and Database username and password match your own Database Server and Credential.
there are two database files and you should use only one of them.there's a Database export from wamp and there's another Database export from "Direct Admin" panel.the export from wamp does not include any pre-entered data and samples.but the "Direct Admin" export includes pre-entered data and samples and i recommend to use this one if it's compatible with your Mysql version.

Admin password for the Project in the Wamp database export is '1' and  admin password for 'Direct Admin' db export is 'admin1395'.Admin passwords are stored with MD5 hash in Database.

Ostad Samples in "Direct Admin" Database export file:
Username	Password
naseri	123456

naderi	123456

zangoei	123456

mohammadi	1234567
